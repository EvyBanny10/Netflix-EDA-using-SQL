# Netflix-EDA-using-SQL
I explored my Netflix data to learn more about my viewing history using exploratory data analysis and SQL. I downloaded my Netflix data directly from my Netflix account. In the csv file, the data had two columns Title and Date. The Title column contained the names of all the shows and movies I watched and the Viewing History column contained the dates that I watched those titles. The date range for my viewing history  was from 03-02-2022 to 03-18-2023. I added two additional columns to my dataset called Genre (the genre of the title) and Category (whether the title was a show or movie).After I cleaned and prepared the data, I explored my viewing history using different aggregate functions. I explored my data to find out that I had more interrest in reality TV shows and my least favorite genre is Holiday's movies.
